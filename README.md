This is a machine learning library developed by ISAAC GIBSON for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah


ASSIGNMENT 3 NOTE

    this will create the raw output files in the same directory as the Perceptron Algorithm. 

    run the run.sh from the perceptron folder or it will not find the training/test files

note: you may have to use chmod to allow execution of the run.sh file
    chmod +x run.sh


ASSIGNMENT 2 NOTE

My ID3 does not work and is affecting the correctness of this assignmet

Some of the code does not work all the way but hopefully you can see the logic
and my attempt at creating the algoritms as discussed in class.





use run.sh shellscript in /DecisionTree/ folder to run tests that will 
automatic print results from console.

./DecisionTree/run.sh

note: you may have to use chmod to allow execution of the run.sh file
    chmod +x run.sh
    
testing will take a few minutes
